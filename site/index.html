              <p><img class="headshot" alt="Ann Suderman" src="./images/headshot.png" />
              ...and I love them to pieces! Honestly, I so enjoy what I do that it&rsquo;s not really fair to call it a &ldquo;job&rdquo;&ndash; it&rsquo;s a joy!<br/>
              </p>
              
              <p>I love to <em>bake</em>, <em>do crafts</em>, <em>read</em> and <em>dance</em> with my little ones. My own children are grown so my attention is fully on your child. Of course, that means I&rsquo;ve been doing this a long time, but I have plenty of patience and tons of energy!</p>
              
              <h2>Lots of hugs, laughs and play.</h2>
              
              <p>I treat my daycare kids like I treated my own kids years ago. I try to make holidays special with parties and treats. I also like to have the families for a get-together every once in a while. The kids just love it when they get to have mom and dad see them at their second home with their friends. Parents enjoy it too!</p>
              
              <p>I&#x27;m reliable and do what ever I can to meet the needs of your family. Also, my hours are flexible as needed. I do keep my numbers small but having a great fit is important!</p>

Since both my husband and I work full-time, Ann&#x27;s flexible schedule has really made it easy for us to manage dropping off and picking up Jack.  We are lucky to have found her.<span class="quote_end">&rdquo;</span></li>
                    <li><span class="quote_start">&ldquo;</span>My daughter was very clingy as she had only been around me &amp; my husband, yet Ann had immense patience with her, loved her, held her, comforted her &amp; nurtured her. Today, she is a second mother to my daughter &amp; it is a huge comfort for me.<span class="quote_end">&rdquo;</span></li>

She spends time doing arts &amp; crafts with the kids, she bakes with them, she has Halloween dress up parties for the kids, get togethers once a year for the families &amp; kids.<span class="quote_end">&rdquo;</span></li>
                    <li><br /><br /><span class="quote_start">&ldquo;</span>Everyone tells me I lucked out in finding Ann, sometimes, I don&rsquo;t realize how lucky I am. Ann &amp; her family have become family to us, I am truly blessed to have found her!<span class="quote_end">&rdquo;</span></li>
