    <h2 id="about">Hello, my kids call me Ann</h2>    
    <img class="headshot" width="332" height="407" alt="Ann Suderman" src="./images/headshot.png" />
    ...and I love them to pieces! Honestly, I so enjoy what I do that it&rsquo;s not really fair to call it a &ldquo;job&rdquo;&ndash; it&rsquo;s a joy!  

    I love to *bake*, *do crafts*, *read* and *dance* with my little ones. My own children are grown so my attention is fully on your child. Of course, that means I&rsquo;ve been doing this a long time, but I have plenty of patience and tons of energy!

    <h2 style="clear:both;">Lots of hugs, laughs and play.</h2>
    I treat my daycare kids like I treated my own kids years ago. I try to make holidays special with parties and treats. I also like to have the families for a get-together every once in a while. The kids just love it when they get to have mom and dad see them at their second home with their friends. Parents enjoy it too!

    I&#x27;m reliable and do what ever I can to meet the needs of your family. Also, my hours are flexible as needed. I like to keep my numbers small and match age groups whenever possible.

    <h2 id="location">Located in Sundance, Calgary SE</h2>
    Handy location near schools and the Sundance industial park.

    Need a reference or two? No problem! Also, a few years back I did get a police check and had a refresher course on CPR. Oh, and my home is **SMOKE-FREE** and I give receipts.
